You really miss the days when 7-segment displays were everywhere: watches, alarm clocks, coffee pots, toasters, uh...watches. Now everything has been replaced by retina displays, or at least really poor quality LCD screens. To recreate that glorious past, you decided to create a library that will render numbers in all of their 7-segment ascii glory.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (by doing this kata), is to create a library (with corresponding tests) that takes an integer input and converts it to the proper multi-line string representation. For example, 1234567890 should render as:

```
    _ _     _    _  _  _  _ 
  | _|_||_||_ |_  ||_||_|| |
  ||_ _|  | _||_| ||_| _||_|

```
